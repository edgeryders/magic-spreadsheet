# Magic Spreadsheets

A collection of spreadsheets that can be used for budgeting, cashflow prediction / monitoring and project monitoring in a small or medium business.

At Edgeryders OÜ, we develop these spreadsheets according to our requirements and best practices as a non-local, cross-national, collective-based organization. In our company, everything is strictly split into "projects", and each project has its own budget. For indirect expenses like accounting costs etc. we have one project called "Core".


## 1. Installation

**These spreadsheets have been developed in Google Sheets.** Due to this, the originals cannot be added here as files. See below how to get a copy of the spreadsheet to your Google Drive. Alternatively, you can use an exported version in Microsoft Excel or LibreOffice Calc format as provided here, but these are *untested and may not work as expected*.

To create a copy of the Spreadsheet in your Google Drive:

1. Open [our public copy of Budget Template v3](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xbi45LE4RglTczENT1Eic1_TSz-5XA4XEIEAuqJgIyo), and create a copy in your Google Drive / Google Drive Enterprise under "File → Make a copy …".

2. Open [our public copy of Magic Spreadsheet v1](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1npctHVZJg37Dg322_4l7OZOvQqaBTJv_E7UVpQF46rI), and create a copy in your Google Drive / Google Drive Enterprise under "File → Make a copy …".
