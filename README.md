# Magic Spreadsheets

A collection of spreadsheets that can be used for budgeting, cash flow prediction and project monitoring in a small or medium business. The spreadsheets are meant to use imported to Google Sheets and will work well there.

At Edgeryders OÃœ, we developed these spreadsheets according to our requirements and best practices as a non-local, cross-national company / collective. In our company, everything is split into "projects", and each project has its own budget.
